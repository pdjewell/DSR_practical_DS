# Front-end application using ML to determine churn
Using [streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/) to make a front-end application for interaction with a deployed machine learning model. 

The application we will make will be to predict customer churn at a telecommunications company, using this [Telco customer churn data](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mechatronixs/telco-churn-prediction-feature-engineering-eda/data) from kaggle.

[Click here to try out the application](https://pdjewell-dsr-practical-ds-streamlit-app-pq1xdu.streamlit.app/)

As well as a live, functioning app, like the one seen [here](https://rachelkberryman-churn-predictor-prediction-streamlit-app-coqysw.streamlitapp.com/).
